Components
============
A server is software or hardware that provides functionality to other components 
called clients. They consist of a  number of types each serving different purposes.
===
A domain name serves to provide a human readable text base representation of an IP 
address. This eases the process of accessing data over a network for users.
The DNS record in ww.foobar.com is of the type A record.
The web server is software that serves requests to clients using the HTTP protocol.
The application server hosts applications or software to be accessed by a business 
or organization.
The role of a database is to store relational or non-relational data that can be 
related and requires easy access, updates and deletion.
Communication between a server and client through the internet is achieved through 
the use of requests sent using the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol.
=======
There are multiple single points of failure in this infrastructure: the database, 
the web server, the app server.
There would be significant downtime during maintenance as the main werver would be 
down and inaccessible for he entire period.
The infrastructure also cannot scale as only one set of servers handles any requests 
incl. a single database
