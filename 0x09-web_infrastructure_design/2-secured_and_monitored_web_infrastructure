Components:
============
The addition of firewalls helps to handle and block any unwanted traffic to our 
servers to prevent the likelihood of a crash from too many requests.
The purpose of an SSL certificate from a certificate manager is to provide encryption
in transit for any data travelling over the internet. It would not be possible to 
intercept the data and read it or modify it.
Monitoring is important to provide information on how our infrastructure is
performing as well as the health of all our components. It makes it possible
to plan for scaling activities or handling failovers.
The monitoring service is able to perform tests on your infrastructure by sending 
requests, analyzing responses, monitoring response times and availlability.
========
Terminating SSL at the load balancer level still exposes therequests as they travel 
to the servers.
Only one db capable of accepting writes is an issue because there is no scaling when
there are periods of high write traffic.
