Additional Elements
====================
The Load Balancer serves to divide traffic between the different servers in order 
to reduce load on individual servers. This is also important when aiming for High 
Availability incase one server fails.
The load balancer implements the least connection algorithm to route traffic to the 
server with the least amount of connections. The setup is active-aactive with both 
server instances live. An active-passive setup would have one of the servers idle 
waiting for failover.
A primary-Replica database setup works such that writes to the primary database are
replicated to all replica databases. Reads can be passed to replicas in order to 
improve database performance.
The Single Point of Failure is the singular load balancer. If it fails, then access
to both servers is blocked.
The security issues include the data travelling to and from the servers not being 
encrypted. This leaves it vulnerable to interception. Lack of a firewall also means 
that it is possible for DDOS attacks to overwhelm the servers as requests are 
allowed from anywhere.
No monitoring means that we would not be able to tell how our setup is performing and
handling requests.
